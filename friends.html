	<h1>Friends are for Life</h1>
	<p>Friends are very important to live a happy life. They give you the meaning of living a life. Without them the life is very dull. Life keeps going without any <b>excitement</b> without good friends. Making friends is the fewest of decision which are taken by ourselves. Other relation like father, mothers, brother, uncle any many others are given to us at the time of birth but not the relation of friendship is imposed on us by birth. So we should choose our friends wisely. They will ultimately effect our life in good or bad way.</p>
